# Icon Assets

Place a single SVG file in this directory:

- `icon.svg` (scalable vector graphic)

The SVG should be square with a viewBox that scales well at different sizes. The icon should represent the concept of "revealing" or "sight" - perhaps an eye icon with a lilac color scheme to match the extension theme.

You can create this icon using any vector graphics editor or find suitable icons from icon libraries like:
- Heroicons
- Feather Icons  
- Material Design Icons

Make sure the SVG follows browser extension guidelines for clarity at small sizes (16px) and uses vector paths for crisp rendering.
